# Practicum-slides-October-26

HW: I am setting this up for revealjs with top-level slides and subdirectories for images.  
I'll include a background image -- but this is just a placeholder.  

I have no idea why github thinks the slides are from Slarti.  I'm off to the Head of the Charles.  Will sort Slarti out upon return.


## Monday 10-25  

Over the weekend I learned that some of you cannot produce slides with Revealjs.  It's a technical issue that seems to affect SOME Mac users -- but not all.  I haven't been able to find it.  So I have produced an ioslides version in addition to the Revealjs version.  We need to pick.  Personally, I would prefer to keep using Revealjs.  But, it's up to the team.
There is a 3red choice, but I'm not sure I have time to produce slides with all three systems.

The RMD files have been renames to NCNM_slides_revealjs.Rmd and NCNM_ioslides-example.Rmd.  I will use them in class this afternoon, too.
