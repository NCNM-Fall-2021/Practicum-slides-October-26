# Practicum-slides-October-26

HW: I am setting this up for revealjs with top-level slides and subdirectories for images.  
I'll include a background image -- but this is just a placeholder.  

I have no idea why github thinks the slides are from Slarti.  I'm off to the Head of the Charles.  Will sort Slarti out upon return.
